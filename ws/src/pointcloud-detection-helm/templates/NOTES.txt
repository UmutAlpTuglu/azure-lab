Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}:{{ .Chart.Version }} .

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }} and can be found in the {{ .Release.Namespace }} namespace.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get all {{ .Release.Name }}

To uninstall, use:

  $ helm -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} uninstall {{ .Release.Name }}

Keep in mind that the namespace still exists afterwards and some types of components (persistent volumes, configmaps, secrets) may be left untouched.

In case of issues, bugs or questions, you can contact the following people:
{{ range .Chart.Maintainers }}
- {{ .Name }} < {{ .Email }} >
{{ end }}
